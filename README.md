# buildnshoot.io v0.4.5
An online multiplayer shooter game

**Please post any bugs or feature requests on the [Issues page](https://github.com/crkellen/bands/issues)!**

##How to play:
###Controls:
**Movement:** Move using the WASD keys.
**Aiming:** Aim using your mouse. Where the mouse points, you will aim.
**Shooting:** Shoot by pressing Left Mouse Button.
**Building:** Switch to Build Mode by pressing Right Mouse Button. Then press Left Mouse Button to build on a tile adjacent to you. **Note:** You cannot build if a player is occupying the tile!

###Goals:
Currently the game is just a endless fighter, but soon there will be objectives for each team to compete for. I have not finalized the goals yet, and there may end up being multiple game modes.

###Tips:
- Blocks can be destroyed by shooting them!
- You can see when the other players have to reload, use this to your advantage!

##Weapons:
Currently there is only a single weapon implemented. More will be added later! Full stats will be added later once they are closer to being finalized.

###Rifle:
High Damage, Slow Fire Rate, Medium Reload Time, Medium Clip Size, Fast Projectile Speed, Good Short-Range Accuracy, Good Long-Range Accuracy.

###SMG (Not Implemented):
Low Damage, Fast Fire Rate, Long Reload Time, Large Clip Size, Average Projectile Speed, Fair Short-Range Accuracy, Fair Long-Range Accuracy.

###Shotgun (Not Implemented):
High Damage, Average Fire Rate, Short Reload Time, Small Clip Size, Average Projectile Speed, Good Short-Range Accuracy, Poor Long-Range Accuracy.

##Updates:
**Please check the CHANGELOG.txt for a list of current updates**

###Planned Features:
- Two teams, players will join either team (with balancing)
- Objectives, this may be a Capture the Flag objective or capture zones, or something else entirely
- At least two other weapons, SMG and Shotgun listed above
- Images for the players, weapons, bullets, blocks
- Rifle will be a hitscan not a projectile
- Some sort of non-intrusive Ad system for monetization
